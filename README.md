# web-scraping-challenge

I have been really struggling after the jupyter notebooks part of this assignment. I was able to scrape everything I wanted to and returned all the information without any hiccups, however when it comes to the .py and .html files, it seems my code or computer is having a problem communicating with the various files. It cannot scrape the info I was able to scrape in my jupyter notebook file. 

I have been trouble shooting for a while and I plan to keep trying to fix this issue until it is resolved. Then, I plan on resubmitting this assignment so I can hopefully break through and get a better grade then I may initially receive.
